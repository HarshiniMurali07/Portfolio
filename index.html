        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with a robust background in machine learning and data science.
            My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, data analysis, and statistical modeling.
            I have successfully applied these skills across various projects, demonstrating my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my recent endeavors, I have focused on developing recommendation systems, performing exploratory data analysis,
            and implementing data preprocessing techniques such as label encoding. These experiences have honed my proficiency
            in tools and libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems and am committed to continuous
            learning and professional growth in the ever-evolving field of machine learning.

            <h3>1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
            <img src="eda_histogram.png" alt="EDA Histogram">
            <p>
                This project focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset. Key tasks included
                analyzing distributions, identifying outliers, and uncovering trends. Visualizations such as histograms
                and scatter plots provided insights into the underlying patterns. EDA helped in transforming raw data into
                a cleaned format suitable for machine learning.

            <h3>2. Station Lines Visualization</h3>
            <img src="station_lines.png" alt="Station Lines">
            <p>
                This project utilized data visualization techniques to plot multi-line graphs representing station lines. Each
                line was styled with unique colors, making patterns easier to interpret. This project demonstrated
                advanced use of visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to make data more intuitive and actionable.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>3. Label Encoding for Categorical Data</h3>
            <img src="label_encoding.png" alt="Label Encoding">
            <p>
                This project focused on preprocessing categorical data using label encoding. The aim was to convert non-numeric
                data into numerical values, ensuring compatibility with machine learning algorithms. Visualizations
                highlighted the distribution of categories before and after encoding, showcasing its impact on model performance.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>4. Product Recommendation System</h3>
            <img src="product_recommendation_scores.png" alt="Product Recommendations">
            <p>
                Built a product recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The model utilized user-product
                interaction data to suggest highly relevant items to individual users. The recommendation accuracy
                and system performance were evaluated using metrics like precision and recall, visualized through bar and heatmap charts.

            <h3>5. Missing Data Analysis</h3>
            <img src="missing_data.png" alt="Missing Data">
            <p>
                This project focused on analyzing and handling missing data. The analysis included identifying features with missing values
                and applying imputation techniques such as mean, median, and mode. Missing data patterns were visualized
                to assess their impact on the dataset's integrity and downstream machine learning workflows.
